# TimeSheetGui

- Hello Everyone! I decided to continue working on more GUI projects in C++. Our Professor had assigned us a more complex GUI assignment for our 
  Mid Term. I had so much fun doing this, as I got to make a timesheet like the ones you see at an actual job! She only wanted two days of the 
  week, as the theme was for someone who works part time only. Therefore, I chose to use Monday and Tuesday as the days of the week! 


 **Here is a video of the TimeSheet (For Best Quality use Full ScreenMode)**
